# This is my portfolio - GKL Development

Portfolio and blog. Used to expose my work and my learning path. All about me and programming.


Portfolio :

	Is composed by the landing page and the experience page. 

	Landing page is all about me, this is where you'll find the 'About' section. 
	Then if interested I invite you to navigate to the experience page where you will be asked for a choice; resume or projects.
	Have a look at both, make yourself comfortable navigating on this website and make sur to leave a feedback if you have any.

Blog :

	The blog is the place where you will be able to check everything I wanted to share about my learning path and programming experience.
	It could be a learning accomplishement where I explain my mental model to understand the subject I learnt. Or you might cross few concepts that amazed me 
	and I decided to share and explain them as I understood.
